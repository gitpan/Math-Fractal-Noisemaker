Math::Fractal::Noisemaker provides a simple functional interface for
generating several types of two‐dimensional grayscale noise, which may
be combined in interesting and novel ways.

Noisemaker is not fast‐‐ but it can output production‐quality seamless
noise for use in games or other media.

See lib/Math/Fractal/Noisemaker.pm for perldoc.
