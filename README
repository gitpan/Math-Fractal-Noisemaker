This module generates various types of two-dimensional grayscale
noise. It is not fast, it is not a faithful implementation of any
particular algorithm, and it probably never will be.

This is old sandbox code written before I discovered the glory of
libnoise. It still has entertainment and educational value for me,
so I've tidied it up a bit and am releasing it to CPAN.

See lib/Fractal/Noisemaker.pm for perldoc.
