.013
  - Added File::Tempdir as a dep in Makefile.PL

.012
  - Rename flame to fflame, tweaked function
  - Tidied code+docs, update SYNOPSIS
  - Add stereo map (thx jhewitt)
  - mandel + dmandel output is now supersampled
  - Tweaked dmandel interestingness criteria
  - Rename to Math::Fractal::Noisemaker
  - Tweak DLA seeding
  - Re-wrote ex/make-samples as t/Noisemaker.t; accepts args

.011
  - Fixes for ridged, shadow, displace

.010
  - Added fur, dmandel, diffusion, flame, infile, intile,
    spiral, voronoi, moire, textile, delta, chiral types
  - Removed rgel, it was too close to pgel
  - Even more futzing with spheremaps, poles conform better now
  - Smoothed input for gel noise
  - Code cleanup

.009
  - Added wavelet, mandel, buddha, fern functions

.008
  - Add missing POD header

.007
  - Added traditional smoothed noise source for Perlin
  - Many new options for combining noise sources
  - New noise types: ridged multifractal and "gel" types
  - Added some simple color mapping options
  - More futzing with spheremap scaling
  - Added gappiness option (ie for starfields)
  - Tweaked defaults for about 500 reasonable complex noise presets
  - Rewrote POD

.006
  - Added a script to generate lots of example noise
  - Tweaked scale at polar regions to more closely match look of equator
  - Refractive spheremaps should look better

.005
  - Added spheremap option! They're fake but good.
  - Added refractive palette option, looks like fractals
  - Fixed bug with size of output images, was off by one in smooth function
  - Added $QUIET option
  - Allow negative feather vals for cool effects
  - Complex noise now skips an un-needed smoothing step
  - Tweaked default args

.004
  - Added example images to ex/ dir and inline with pod

Sep 2009: .001
